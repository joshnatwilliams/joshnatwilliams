Hi, I’m Josh and I'm a current grad student studying Information Technology Strategy with a concentration in Data Analytics. In undergrad, 
I fell in love with Stochastic Modeling, Systems Dynamics Simulation, and Decision Analysis. I'm currently learning about Machine Learning, 
NLP,AI methods for social good, and various other topics. My hobbies are guitar, video games, and watching Formula 1. I hope to use this page to post my projects
and track of my progress in data science.
